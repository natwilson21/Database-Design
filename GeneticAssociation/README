GAD: The Genetic Association Database Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to research and explore the GAD database to re-discover some possible biological
connections between seemingly disparate diseases. The GAD database is a simple catalog of research papers reporting an association
or lack of association between genes and disease. 
The gad table has the following columns:
  gad_id – The table’s primary key 
  association – Whether there is a positive association (‘Y’) or not (‘N’) or it is uncertain (‘ ‘)
  phenotype – The name of the disease or condition
  disease_class – The disease class (e.g., NEUROLOGICAL)
  chromosome – The human chromosome where the gene can be found (1, 2, 3, ..., 22, X, Y, M) 
  chromosome_band – A descriptor for the chromosomal region
  dna_start – The nucleotide position on the chromosome where the gene begins
  dna_end – The nucleotide position on the chromosome the gene ends
  gene – The official gene symbol
  gene_name – The gene’s full name
  reference – The research paper where the association was reported
  pubmed_id – The Pubmed ID (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
  year – Year of the publication
  population – The population associated with the research study that reported the association.

The GAD table may contain inconsistent spelling or punctuation. Some columns contain lists of values rather than single values. 
The GAD database data is not normalized. 

PART A:
Write SQL Queries to answer the 13 questions within the sql file. 

PART B:
Explore the GAD database to research and investigate a possible question regarding the information in the database. 
Create a powerpoint slide with graphs or charts derived from the data created to help support your findings.
